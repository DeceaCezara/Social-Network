# Social Network Application

## Project Overview

As part of a semester-long faculty project, I had the opportunity to enhance my Java skills and explore various aspects of software development. Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience in the following areas:

- **Domain-Driven Design:** Applied domain-driven design principles to model the structure and behaviour of the social network application.

- **Lambda Expressions:** Utilized lambda expressions to write concise and expressive code, enhancing the readability of the application.

- **JavaFX UI Development:** Designed and implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX for a user-friendly and interactive experience.

- **Database Connectivity:** Established connections to a PostgreSQL database, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Observer Pattern:** Applied the observer pattern to enhance communication and coordination between different components of the application.

The project served as an excellent opportunity to build upon my existing Java expertise while venturing into new and exciting areas of the language.
